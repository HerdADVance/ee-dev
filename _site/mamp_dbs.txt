MAMP PRO will create copies of the MySQL databases located in

/Applications/MAMP/db/mysql57

and store them in

/Library/Application Support/appsolute/MAMP PRO/db/mysql57

Any modifications you make using MAMP PRO will go to these copies and will not be available in MAMP (which will continue to use the original databases).
